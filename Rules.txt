I need to make the comunication between a client and a server.

THE SERVER NEEDS TO START FIRST and when started it must print a PID

The client will take 2 paramters:

 - The pid
 - The string to send

The client will send the string to the server and when the server recieves it it will print it.

1 second to display 100 characters is way to much.
So make it quick

The server needs to be able to take strings from multiple servers without the need to restart

The communication between the server and client can only be done using UNIX signals

I can only send this 2 signals:
SIGUSR1
SIGUSR2
